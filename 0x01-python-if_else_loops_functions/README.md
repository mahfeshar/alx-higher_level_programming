# 0x01 Python - if/else, loops, functions

This folder contains Python scripts as part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum. In this module, we delve into control flow in Python, including conditional statements (if/else), loops (while and for), and functions.

## Files

- `0-positive_or_negative.py`: Python script that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` and prints whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.
- `1-last_digit.py`: Python script that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` and prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.
- `2-print_alphabet.py`: Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
- `3-print_alphabt.py`: Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet (in lowercase), excluding the letters `q` and `e`, not followed by a new line.
- `4-print_hexa.py`: Python script that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example).
- `5-print_comb2.py`: Python script that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
- `6-print_comb3.py`: Python script that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
- `7-islower.py`: Python function that checks for lowercase character.
- `8-uppercase.py`: Python function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
- `9-print_last_digit.py`: Python function that prints the last digit of a number.
- `10-add.py`: Python function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- `11-pow.py`: Python function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and return the value.
- `12-fizzbuzz.py`: Python function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
- `13-insert_number.c, lists.h`: C function in a Python script that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
- `100-print_tebahpla.py`: Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase.
- `101-remove_char_at.py`: Python function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position `n`.
- `102-magic_calculation.py`: Python function matching exactly a bytecode provided.
